Hey everyone! 👋

I'm strictly a developer at heart. Give me a complex backend problem or a React component to optimize, and I'm happy. But ask me to pick a color palette or design a logo? That's where I usually stare at a blank screen for hours.

I realized I wasn't alone in this. Many of us "indie hackers" and developers have great ideas but get stuck on the visual identity part of launching a product. We just need something "good enough" to get started and look professional.

That is exactly why I built **InitBrand**.

[InitBrand](https://initbrand.dev) is an AI-powered tool designed to generate a complete brand identity for your project in seconds, not days.

## 🚀 What it does

The goal was to make the process as frictionless as possible:

1.  **Describe your project**: Just type a sentence about what you are building.
2.  **AI Magic**: The app uses advanced image generation models (via Replicate) to create unique logo concepts.
3.  **Automatic Branding**: It doesn't just stop at the image. It analyzes the logo to extract a harmonious color palette (Primary, Secondary, Accent) that you can immediately use in your CSS or Tailwind config.
4.  **Download & Go**: You get a nice brand kit zip file with everything you need.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

For those interested in the tech stack, I built this using:

- **Nuxt**: For the full-stack framework (it's been a joy to use).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For all the styling.
- **Gemini & Replicate**: These are the engines driving the creative generation.

It's been a fun challenge integrating these AI tools into a smooth web flow. I wanted the experience to feel magical—like you have a designer sitting next to you sketching ideas.

## Give it a spin!

I'd love for you to try it out for your next side project (or just for fun).

Let me know what you think! I'm actively working on it, so if you have feature requests or run into any weird AI results, tell me. Happy building!
