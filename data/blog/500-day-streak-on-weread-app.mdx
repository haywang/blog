## Weread

WeRead is an app similar to Kindle. You can read both free and paid books on it. Last July, the number of free books started to decrease, and many books became available only for purchase or with a membership.

I found the reading challenge activity by accident. First, I joined the 7-day streak challenge, then I got a few days of membership to continue reading. After that, I joined the 21-day streak and the 30-day streak. Two months ago, I joined the 365-day streak challenge.

At first, I didn’t think I could persist for so many days. I just thought it was interesting. But after maintaining a 500-day streak, reading one hour per day, I developed a habit of reading. If I come across something I don’t understand, I look for the book and read it. It has become as easy as drinking water.

The only drawback is the abundance of translated books. Next year, I will read more English books instead of translated Chinese books. I plan to work in an English-speaking environment, and reading English books will help me improve my English skills.

## Duolingo

I practice my spoken English every day on Duolingo. It has different medals to motivate you to achieve your goals. If you stop, the app will notify you via notifications, email, or SMS. These reminders encourage you to develop a micro habit, so it becomes automatic.

## Programming

I study programming in college. When I bought my computer, I started learning microcontroller programming using C language. When I do DIY projects, I’m happy; it drives me to learn more and more. Eventually, I became an electronics engineer and a frontend developer. These skills allow me to create products to sell or use, and I’m happy to make things.
