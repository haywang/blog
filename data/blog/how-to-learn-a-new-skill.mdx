As a frontend developer, I know that frontend skills evolve rapidly. I learn something new every day. If I’m afraid to learn, I’ll fall behind my peers.

At the beginning, I don’t understand the new skill. So, I start with a tutorial. I type out every piece of code manually. It’s a slow process, but it works. Typing the code helps me encounter and resolve issues along the way. By fixing these issues, I learn the new skill more effectively.

By the end of the tutorial, I’ve taken my first step into the new skill. Next, I create my own project from scratch. At the same time, I carefully read the official documentation. This process helps me handle simple tasks. Finally, I learn even more by studying others’ code on platforms like GitHub or blogs.

Confidence is very important in the learning process. From the beginning, I remind myself that I will eventually become an expert. Every bit of progress motivates me to keep going further.
