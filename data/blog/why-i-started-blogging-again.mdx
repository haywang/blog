## RIP My Old Blog

In 2015, I set up a blog with WordPress. It lasted about two years before I stopped it. This blog is censored.
If you write a post, after several years, its content may no longer be suitable for publication. The government may ask you to delete that post.
I don't like that; I want the freedom to decide which posts to delete instead of being told to delete them.

## New Beginnings

This is my new blog, which is focused on frontend technology, with no other content.
This world has changed since 2018; there is too much political correctnessâ€”no logic, no normal values.
I want to share my knowledge with others in a relaxed manner.
Thanks for subscribing to my blog.
