These days, as we celebrate the Chinese New Year, my wife and I took our son on a trip to Hong Kong, Macau, and several cities in the south.

During the first week, my son was full of energy, running and playing. However, after a few days, he fell sick twice, and we had to take breaks to let him recover. Sometimes, my wife and I had to carry him because he was so weak.

Despite the challenges, we were very happy. My son saw many foreigners speaking different languages. He was curious and wanted to play with them, eager to learn a new language to communicate with other kids. I explained to him that learning a new language takes time—it’s not something he could master in just a few days.

For this trip, I didn’t prepare much in advance, as planning takes a lot of energy. In hindsight, better preparation would have made the journey smoother—choosing the best places to visit, figuring out transportation, and scheduling activities to minimize unnecessary hassles. Like any other task, good preparation leads to a better experience. Thankfully, with the help of ChatGPT, I was still able to manage without too much effort.

After returning from our trip, I took several days to rest and recover. Now, as my body regains energy, it’s time to get back to work. A new year has begun, bringing new hopes and aspirations.
