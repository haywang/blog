I was laid off in July because the companyâ€™s business kept shrinking. I had assumed I might be laid off next year, but suddenly, I was informed it would happen sooner. Interestingly, I received a promotion and a salary increase in 2022. From 2019 to 2024, I witnessed the business grow larger and larger, only to shrink again.

First, I asked my headhunters to help send my resume to large companies. However, I was met with the harsh reality: there were no suitable job openings for me. The lack of opportunities seems to be a long-term trend, not something that will resolve in just a few years.

Next, I started submitting job applications on LinkedIn, aiming for remote work opportunities. Unfortunately, I faced numerous rejections, and it felt like a waste of time.

Last month, I registered an account on Upwork. Since my resume is accurate and complete, the registration process went smoothly without any issues.

However, when I started sending proposals, only one of them was viewed. This left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. As a new freelancer with no work history or Job Success Score, getting my first hire has proven to be a real challenge.

I plan to earn money on Upwork using my coding skills. This is a long-term goal for me. To succeed, I know I need to improve my proposal-writing skills and make my profile more professional and credible. I am determined to work hard to achieve this.

Because this is a long-term plan, I am committed to keeping my information accurate and honest. If I were to lie, it could become a problem in the future. By staying honest, building expertise, and with a bit of luck, I believe I can achieve good results.
