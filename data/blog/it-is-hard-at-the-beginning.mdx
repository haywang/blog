## No JSS

I’m new to Upwork, with no Job Success Score or work history. It’s hard for me to get my first job. I believe it’s just a matter of probability. There may be a kind client who doesn’t care about those things and will just give me a chance to try. So, I send ten proposals per day. About 20% of the proposals will be viewed by clients. Eventually, one client will hire me. It’s a convenience drop model.

## Tired

All day, I look at many job posts, discard those that are unclear, urgent, unrelated to my skills, or have too many applicants. Few will suit me. I’m tired, so I take a break at lunch. After I earn some money, I will delegate the job to someone else and focus on coding to meet the client’s requirements.

## Money

My wife doesn’t fully understand my job, so I simply explain to her that I sell my programming skills to clients who will pay for my time and expertise. In the end, she asks when I will earn money. I don’t know how to answer that. If I earn even one dollar, I will confidently answer her question, but I haven’t earned anything yet.

## Future

If I haven’t earned any money by May next year, I will quit and look for a job in my country. It will be very hard because there are few job opportunities unless something significant happens and companies start hiring in large numbers. Right now, I must struggle to find a job to prove that the road ahead will get easier. Austin, come on.
