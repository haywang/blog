Last Thursday, a client reported an issue with recording on Safari. However, when I tried to inspect the webpage on Mobile Safari, I realized I didnâ€™t have a Type-C cable in my bag. I couldnâ€™t use the wireless inspection feature because enabling it for the first time requires a USB connectionâ€”something I hadnâ€™t set up yet since I had recently bought this computer.

There are three methods to inspect an iOS device:

## 1. Using a USB Cable

Before you can inspect your iPhone via a Mac, you need to enable Web Inspector on your device.

**Step 1: Enable Web Inspector on iPhone**

1. Open the **Settings** app.

2. Go to **Safari** > **Advanced**.

3. Enable the **Web Inspector** toggle.

**Step 2: Set Up Safari on Mac**

1. Open **Safari** on your Mac.

2. Go to **Settings** (Preferences).

3. Navigate to **Advanced** and check the box: **Show Develop menu in menu bar**.

**Step 3: Connect Your iPhone via USB**

1. Plug your iPhone into your Mac using a USB cable.

2. When prompted, tap **Trust** on your iPhone to establish the connection.

3. If a privacy dialog appears on your Mac and closes too quickly, you need to click it quickly to confirm accessâ€”itâ€™s a bit tricky.

**Step 4: Inspect Your Webpage**

1. Click the **Develop** menu at the top of Safari.

2. Your connected device should appear in the dropdown menu.

3. Hover over it, and youâ€™ll see a list of open web pages. Click on one to inspect it.

## 2. Wireless Inspection

Once youâ€™ve successfully set up USB debugging, you can enable wireless debugging to inspect pages without a cable.

1. At the bottom of the **Inspect Webpage** panel, click **Connect via Network**.

2. Turn on the switch for **Wireless Debugging**.

3. Ensure your iPhone and Mac are connected to the same WiFi network.

4. Keep your iPhone unlocked while debugging.

This method is very convenient when you donâ€™t have a USB cable. Since I dislike frequently plugging and unplugging cables, I prefer using wireless debugging.

## 3. Using vConsole

[vConsole](https://github.com/Tencent/vConsole) is an open-source debugging tool developed by Tencent.

Itâ€™s a lightweight, extendable frontend debugging tool for mobile web pages. You can integrate it into your website, and a vConsole icon will appear at the bottom-right corner of the screen. Clicking the icon will open a developer console, allowing you to inspect logs and debug issues directly from your phone.

In my previous company, we used vConsole extensively in development environments.

I hope this guide helps! If you found it useful, donâ€™t hesitate to share it. ðŸš€
