A few days ago, I connected my Mac Mini to an old TV. My son loves playing car racing games at the playground, so I searched the App Store for similar games. Instead, he got intrigued by Minecraft. It was his first time playing, and he simply chopped trees and mined stones, digging deeper into the ground. He thought it was fascinating. Minecraft is open-ended, allowing players to play freely and creatively.

Personally, I don’t usually play games because I see them as a waste of time. A short gaming session can be a nice break, but playing for more than three hours gives me a headache. Games are designed to keep you hooked, and without self-discipline, it’s easy to get lost in them. That’s why I’ve set time limits for my son’s playtime.

Recently, I learned some skills in the game with the help of ChatGPT. Now, I can craft tools, use coordinates to find my way home, and even domesticate wolves to help me fight enemies. I’ve come to understand why my son enjoys Minecraft so much. It’s open-ended and limitless, letting players use their creativity. However, I’ve realized that my approach—always trying to survive using the “best practices”—can sometimes restrict my creativity.

Minecraft is a fantastic game for parents to play with their kids. Just remember not to spend too much time on it. Enjoy the journey of exploration and discovery!
