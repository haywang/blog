In the past few months, I have been using Cursor and Windsurf IDE. When I input a request prompt, they quickly generate code, and sometimes I can even see the final UI. If a bug occurs, they fix it automatically. This makes me wonder: **Will frontend developers eventually disappear?**

## What AI Can Do

### 1. Boost Development Efficiency

IDE tools integrated with ChatGPT significantly speed up frontend development. If a design is created in Figma, AI can generate HTML or framework-based code. Frontend engineers will primarily debug and optimize the code to meet project requirements. **In the future, junior frontend developers may be replaced by AI.**

### 2. AI + Frontend Development

If AI can handle simple and repetitive tasks, frontend engineers will shift toward more complex work that AI cannot easily manage. This includes **business logic, UX improvements, and strategic decision-making.**

### 3. AI + Frontend Prompt Engineering

New AI-powered IDEs still struggle to fully understand specific development requirements. However, **a frontend engineer skilled in writing effective AI prompts** can gain a competitive edge over peers by leveraging AI more efficiently.

## What Can I Do?

Even though AI might replace certain aspects of frontend development, I must learn to work alongside it. AI enhances efficiency and will continue to become more powerful. However, **human creativity, user experience design, and problem-solving remain critical skills** that AI cannot fully replace.

Additionally, **becoming a full-stack developer** will provide more flexibility and make me more valuable to startups and clients. Just like during the Industrial Revolution, **manual labor was replaced, but new jobs emerged**. AI, like ChatGPT, is a wave of change—I must embrace it from the very beginning.
