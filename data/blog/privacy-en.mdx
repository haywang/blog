## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Upwork Assistant ("we", "our", or "extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

Upwork Assistant is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect and process the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our service:

1. **Browser Storage Data**: We store your language preference (English or Chinese) locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This information never leaves your device.

2. **Website Data**: Our extension only processes data on Upwork.com domains. It observes and extracts information from pages, including:
   - Budget/hourly rate information
   - Proposal statistics
   - Client information
   - Connects required for job applications
   - Hire rates

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely to:

1. Provide you with enhanced visualization on Upwork.com

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not:

- Sell your personal data to third parties
- Share your browsing history with anyone
- Collect or transmit any of your personal information to external servers
- Track your activity outside of Upwork.com

## Data Security

Since all data processing happens locally within your browser and no data is transmitted to external servers, your information remains secure on your device. The extension only has permissions to run on Upwork.com domains.

- Change your language preference through the extension's popup interface
- Disable or remove the extension at any time through Chrome's extension management
