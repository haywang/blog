I bought my house in 2017. It’s an old house built in 1998, and over the years, I’ve fixed countless issues without external help.

I studied communication in college. After graduating, I became a firmware engineer. This background gave me a good understanding of circuits and basic repairs. I’ve also invested in various tools to support my DIY efforts.

Whenever household electrical appliances break down, I take the opportunity to learn their **working principles** through videos online. It may take some time, but I see it as a chance to acquire knowledge beyond programming. It keeps my learning skills sharp and up-to-date. Moreover, successfully fixing something brings immense satisfaction—it’s always worth the effort.

Sure, I could hire someone to handle repairs, and it wouldn’t cost much. But I believe that relying too much on others would make me lose the ability to solve problems independently. For me, maintaining and improving my learning skills is essential.

Skills that aren’t used regularly tend to fade away quickly. Recently, I’ve been working on websites using my frontend experience. The field evolves rapidly, and if I stop learning, I risk falling behind my peers in the industry.

By embracing challenges and continuously learning, I aim to stay adaptable and prepared for the future.
