My name is Austin. After graduating, I worked as a firmware engineer. Then I quit my job to design a children's programming course and sell it.

A year later, I started working again as a software engineer and began to learn frontend technologies. One year later, I looked for a frontend job and eventually worked at a finance company for five years.

Now I'm looking for remote work. I value freedom and don’t enjoy being stuck at a monitor all day. I’ve come to realize that whether as a firmware engineer, software engineer, or frontend developer, all three roles ultimately involve creating products for customers.

Now I’m participating in open source projects and learning SwiftUI. I plan to develop several apps for the App Store. All these efforts are leading me toward greater freedom.

Just do it, and let the results take their course. Wish me luck!
